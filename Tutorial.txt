---- Tutorial for AI developers ------
======================================

0. Read README.md.

1. Create at least two classes. One should extend wota.gameobjects.AntAI
   and the other wota.gameobjects.HillAI. These files will contain your AI.
   It is important that your files are located in a subfolder of src/wota/ai/.
   Correspondingly, your class should reside in a subpackage of wota.ai, 
   write
     package wota.ai.<my-ai-name>;
   at the top of your files, where my-ai-name is the name of the subfolder you are using.
   
2. Both classes have to override the method 
     public void tick()
   this method gets called every tick of the game and for every ant separately.
   
3. You have one hill which is able to produce new ants if enough food is available.
   Have a look at the sample AIs in wota.ai to see how you 
   can create new ants. If you copied src/wota/ai/template/HillAI.java to get started, you
   can look at this hill AI's tick method.
   
4. For the other ants use the methods and fields from AntAI to perceive the environment
   of the ant and to interact. You can find sample AIs in wota.ai.
   Game constants may be found in parameters, a member of AntAI, which is an instance of
   wota.gameobjects.Parameters. Do not hesitate to look at its source code and parameters.txt
   to see the actual parameter values.

5. You can start the game by loading your AIs in wota.gamemaster.Wota and executing
   its main. Keep in mind that you have to specify the name of the folder containing your AI.
   Your hill will need to produce ants at the beginning of the game.
   
6. If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask them, for example by emailing one of 
   us, talking to us or creating an issue on:
     http://github.com/wotateam/wota/issues 

7. Please send us your AIs no matter how primitive you perceive them to be. This will help us a lot.

8. Have fun!
