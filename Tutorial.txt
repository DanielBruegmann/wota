---- Tutorial for AI developers ------
======================================

1. Create at least two classes. One should inherit de.wota.gameobjects.AntAI
   and the other de.wota.gameobjects.QueenAI. These files will contain your AI.
   It is important that your files are located in src/de/wota/ai/ or one of its 
   subfolders. Correspondingly, your class should reside in de.wota.ai or one of 
   its subpackages, write 
     package de.wota.ai.<my-subpackage>;
   at the top of your files.
   
2. Both classes have to override the method 
     public void tick()
   this method gets called in every tick of the game and for every ant separately.
   
3. You have one queen which is able to produce new ants if enough food is available.
   Have a look at the sample AIs in de.wota.ai to see how you can create new Ants.   
   
4. For the other ants use the methods and fields from AntAI to perceive the environment
   of the ant and to interact. You can find sample AIs in de.wota.ai.
   Game constants may be found in de.wota.gameobjects.Parameters.

5. You can start the game by loading your AIs in de.wota.gamemaster.Wota and executing
   its main. Keep in mind that you have to specify the name of your QueenAI. Your QueenAI
   should then create the other ants using QueenAI.createAnt(...).
   
6. If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask them, for example by emailing one of 
   us, talking to us or creating an issue on:
     http://github.com/DanielBruegmann/wota/issues 

7. Please send us your AIs no matter how primitive they are. This will help us a lot.

8. Have fun!
