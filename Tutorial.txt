---- Tutorial for AI developers ------
======================================

1. Create at least two classes. One should inherit de.wota.gameobjects.AntAI
   and the other de.wota.gameobjects.QueenAI. These files will contain your AI.
   It is important that your files are located in de.wota.ai. 
   
2. Both classes have to override the method 
     public void tick()
   this method gets called in every tick of the game and for every Ant seperately.
   
3. You have one Queen which is able to produce new Ants if enough food is available.
   Have a look at the sample AIs in de.wota.ai to see how you can order new Ants.   
   
4. For the other Ants use the methods and fields from AntAI to perceive the environment
   of the Ant and to interact. You can also find sample AIs in de.wota.ai.
   Game constants are saved in gameobjects.Parameters.

5. You can start the Game by loading your AIs in de.wota.gamemaster.Wota and executing
   its main. Keep in mind that you have to specify the name of your QueenAI. Your QueenAI
   should then order (=build) the other Ants.
   
6. If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask them.

7. Please send us your AIs no matter how primitive they are. This will help us a lot.

8. Have fun!
